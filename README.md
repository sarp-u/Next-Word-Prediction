# Next-Word-Prediction
Next word prediction using RNN and LSTM. This repository contains the code that is currently used in my thesis.
Deep learning algorithms became the most successful methods for Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks. Models that work successfully with sequential data, such as
RNN and LSTM, offer an easy and understandable solution to such NLP problems. A recurrent neural network(RNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to work with sequential data used for classification and regression problems. Different types of Recurrent Neural Networks are used and described in the thesis. These algorithms are used as a baseline model for our time series forecasting. They have a substantial effect on the learning process. The purpose of the thesis is to successfully complete a given sentence with the right next word with the help of RNN and LSTM in a language such as Turkish, which is not so rich in terms of the number of words such as English and German, and which is separated from the other languages in terms of language tree.

Both codes that I have used in this thesis are specified in the links below, and the evaluation was made with these two models.
